#  Student Marks Prediction — Linear Regression Model

##  Project Overview

This project is a **Supervised Machine Learning application** that predicts student marks based on the number of hours studied.

It demonstrates the **end-to-end ML workflow**, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive web application.

This project was built to gain hands-on experience in real-world Machine Learning model development and deployment.

##  Problem Statement

Many students want to estimate their expected marks based on study time.

However, there is no simple tool available to quickly predict performance outcomes.

This project solves the problem by providing a **data-driven prediction system** using Linear Regression.
